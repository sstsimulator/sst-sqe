# Software tests for the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST)

These tests are used to validate changes to `sst-core` prior to accepting those changes into the development and then master branch of `sst-core`.

All of the tests used for SST are available on github, specifically
- this repo, and
- <https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-elements>, and
- network traces from <https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-downloads/releases/tag/TestFiles>
